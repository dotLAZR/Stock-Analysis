* In the Analysis of the trading year 2017, it shows us that Steve’s stock of choice “DQ” would have provided a great return of almost 200%. Other stocks that provided positive returns are ENPH and FSLR with both providng over 100% in returns.
* Looking deeper the data shows that the Total Daily Volume for our stock “DQ” was the lowest of the stocks. Although the return was 199% the sample size was significantly smaller compared to the rest of the stocks.

    * Refactoring the code has shown its clear advantages as it is more efficent in terms of how long it takes to loop and collect the data. As well as being more felxible in terms of different kinds of data you may be to reuse the code for.
    * One of the disadvantages of beggining to refactor code is that it can easily be lost in the refactoring process. Using our code from the module as a reference and switching between one and the other caused me to lose some of the code from the module promting backtracking to fix code.
