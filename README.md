## Analysis of stock(s) return between 2017-18. 

  - Helping Steve analyze the percentage return of green stocks over 2 years in order to help Steve's parents get the best possible return on investment. 

  - Looking into Total Daily Volume as well as net percentage return of traded stock to assess stock performance at the click of a button.

## Results

* In the analysis of the trading year 2017, it shows us that Steve’s stock of choice “DQ” would have provided a great return of almost 200%. Other stocks that provided positive returns are ENPH and FSLR with both providing over 100% in returns.
* Looking deeper the data shows that the Total Daily Volume for our stock “DQ” was the lowest of the stocks. Although the return was 199% the sample size was significantly smaller compared to the rest of the stocks.

 
### 2018

* Looking at the following year DQ, with now a significantly higher daily volume of traded stocks, has dropped to a return of -62%. Showing us that the more people traded the stock the more it dropped in returns. 
* The data suggest the best possible stock Steve's parents should invest in is ENPH, almost tripling in Total Daily Volume, it has still managed to provide a positive return of more than 80%. 

## Summary

  ### Refactoring
  
  * Refactoring the code has shown its clear advantages as it is more efficient in terms of how long it takes to loop through and collect the data. As well as being more flexible in terms of different kinds of data you may be able to reuse the code for.

* One of the disadvantages of beginning to refactor code is that it can easily be lost in the refactoring process. Using our code from the module as a reference and switching between one and the other caused me to lose some of the code from the module prompting backtracking to fix code.
